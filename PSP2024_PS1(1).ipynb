Wishing to be a very nice sister, she decided to look for 3 stickers of Gilardino that she could gift to her brother and his friends. She knew that in the album there was space for 300 players, the stickers were sold in packets of 6 cards each, and each packet costed 0.25 cents. Each player had the same probability of appearing on a sticker and in a packet you can find the same player more than once.\n",

What should be the probability of finding Gilardino on a sticker to know that her median expense does not exceed 4 euros? To reply to this, consider possible probabilities that range from 1/100 to 1/10 with steps of 0.01. Once you have computed the median for each of these probabilities $p$, plot $p$ vs the corresponding median and draw an horizontal line to indentify the value 4 for the median. [2]"

What is the expected number of defaulting loans? What is the probability than more than 1% of the loans default? To solve this, you can either simulate things numerically or give the exact answer using the methods that we have seen for random variables. [5]\n",

Now that you have established a baseline probability, you know that reality is a bit more complicated than that, so you want to compute the same two quantities (expected value and probability than more than 1% of the loans default) for the 2000 loans, but this time you assume that 100 of them have probability of default 0.01, 900 have probability of default 0.008 and 1000 have probability of default 0.005.

This time, the second and third group of loans are like in point 2 (i.e. the groups with 900 and 1000 loans), but the first group of 100 loans behaves slightly differently: the first 2 loans of group 1 have probability 0.1 of defaulting and, if these first 2 loans default, then all the other 90 will default too, while if the first 2 loans do not default, then the others default independently with probability 0.01. Compute the expected number of defaulting loans and the probability than more than 1% of the loans default. For this answer, you can use a sampling method. [2]"
