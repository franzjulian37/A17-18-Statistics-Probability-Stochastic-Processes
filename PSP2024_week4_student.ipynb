Other arguments that go into the function are `alpha` which specifies the degree of transparency (between 0 and 1, by default 1) and `label` if we want to identify the two bar plots with a different label (since we do define the bar plots one after the other, python automatically chooses diffent colours. If we want to specify another colour, we can do so with the argument `color`). If we specify a label, we need to call `plt.legend()` so that the legend shows on the plot.
